This is a project to help visualize the way sorting algorithms work.
The Sorting Simulation is a basic simulation software which you can simulate a few sorting algorithms. You can set sorting algorithm, speed and number of sticks.

Every stick represents a number; then the software begins to sort them with algorithm which you select before. At the end, you can check comparison number and elapsed time. So you can consolidate your knows.

### How to Play the game:
Select the type of sorting algorithm then select the order of in ascending  or desending by pressing ` A ` or ` D ` key respectfully and Finally to solve the board press `SPACEBAR`, sit back and watch the vizualization algorithm run or press ` R ` to reset it.

# Algorithims
- Basic sort and search algorithms</br>

## Bubble Sort </br>
- Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in</br> order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.</br>

## Insertion Sort
- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. </br>
 Time Complexity: O(n*n) </br>
 Space Complexity: O(1) </br>
 It is a stable algorithm because it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys. </br>

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO FORK THE PROJECT AND START CONTRIBUTING. :)

### Module used
python modules
```
import pygame
```

## PRE-REQUISITES
Your laptop with python 3.6.x (onwards) installed.

**NOTE:** Those with Linux and MacOSX would have Python installed by default, no action required.

Windows: Download the version for your laptop via https://www.python.org/downloads/

**NOTES**
In your preferred editor, make sure indentation is set to "4 spaces".

* Make sure you have **pygame** installed in python otherwise code may fail, to install pygame in your machine > open python in your terminal then type `pip install pygame` to install. :warning:

---

## Run using Python3.8+
1. Clone or download repositiory: https://github.com/arevish/Sorting-Algorithim-Visualizer.git
2. In source folder, run `python3 'main.py'` to start program, optionally, run with `--help` argument to see other runtime options.
